## **1. Professional Self-Assessment**

While in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have learned the importance of knowing when to seek answers and when to create my own solutions while being aware of my strengths and weaknesses. To not give up and to push through any roadblocks. To learn and grow from my failures as much as from my successes. Within the computer science program, I have gained experience with many programming languages and libraries. With that experience I am able to quickly learn new programming languages and libraries, as well as convert code from one programming language to another while maintaining coding best practices. I have learned to always consider security, data integrity, readability, and collaboration.

The artifact that I chose for this portfolio is a login application with a database. I created this artifact to display my skills and abilities in the following three categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithm and Data Structures, and Databases. In this portfolio I have included details on enhancements that I planned and completed for this artifact based on the mentioned categories.

## **3. Software Design and Engineering**

The login application with database was written in Python incorporating the Pandas and SQLite libraries. This artifact allows the user to: login, create new user, and change password. Once logged in, the user gains access to the main menu which allows for create, read, update, and delete operations within the local database. The main menu features options to: display all customer records, add a new customer record, add new customer records by uploading an Excel file, search database for customer records, update customer account balance, and delete customer record.

To enhance the artifact, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by converting the application to JavaScript and HTML, allowing users to access the application from any computer via internet browser.

I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by writing readable code and comments that consider collaboration.

### **List of completed enhancements**
- Convert code from Python to JavaScript and HTML
- Usability within internet browser
- Easy to understand code comments
- Easy to follow user communications and menus

## **4. Algorithms and Data Structure**

To enhance the artifact, I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design by adding new user options to update user access levels and transfer funds between customer accounts. I also created an HTML file loader and JavaScript event listener for accepting Excel files to add multiple customer records.

I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by adding security checks that test all strings and numbers for special characters and length before they are passed to the database functions.

### **List of completed enhancements**
- New function that transfers a user specified amount of funds between two customers
- New function that updates user access level
- New functions that check user entered strings and numbers for special characters and length
- New function that checks user uploaded Excel files for special characters and length
- HTML Excel file loader
- Event listener for Excel file loading and processing

## **5. Databases**

To enhance the artifact, I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by converting the local database to an online MongoDB Atlas database and converting SQL queries to NoSQL queries within "try, catch, finally" statements that connect and close the database client while catching errors.

### **List of completed enhancements**
- Convert local database to online MongoDB Atlas database
- Convert SQL queries to NoSQL
- Implement "try, catch, finally" statements
- Query for customer funds transfer
- Query for updating user access level
